## Todewy

[Todewy](todewy.com) is a social todo-list app created by developer Elizabeth Ha using the [Flutter](flutter.dev) framework.  

The goal of this project is to make a partial, frontend clone of the app using [SolidJS](solidjs.com) and [Tailwind CSS](tailwindcss.com) for the purpose of learning Solid and improving my use of Typescript/Javascript.  
Depending on the success with this project, I plan to make an simple accompanying backend server using Flask/Python.
